# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This project is a geo cache video game where the player can move about the world and combine tokens to achieve desired combo.
The project is also an experience into practicing the use of Leaflet, setting up and updating a PLAN.md file, able to run on a mobile browser across many browser sessions, and practicing flyweight, facade, and memento design patterns.
